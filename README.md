# Music Genre Classification Project

## Overview
This project leverages KNN and Random Forest models to classify music genres, utilizing the GTZAN dataset. A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit enables users to input audio features or upload tracks for genre prediction. The implementation of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) provides explanations for model predictions, helping users understand why a specific genre is suggested for a track. The supported genres include Rock, Pop, Jazz, Hip-hop, Classical, Blues, Country, Disco, Metal, and Reggae.
